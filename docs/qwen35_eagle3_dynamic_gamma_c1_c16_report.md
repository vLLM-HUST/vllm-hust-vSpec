# Qwen3.5-35B-A3B EAGLE3 Dynamic Gamma C1-C16

## Test setup

- Target: `/workspace/models/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B`
- EAGLE3: `/workspace/models/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Eagle3-Specforge`
- Dataset: GSM8K materialized benchmark set
- Requests: 64
- Output length: 256
- Tensor parallelism: TP2
- Execution: graph (`FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`), asynchronous scheduling
- Dynamic gamma candidates: 1-6
- Refill: cohort-boundary admission, with no fixed refill size or hold count
- Baseline: the fixed target-only C1-C16 results from `20260929-c1-c16`; it was not rerun

| 11 | 409.08 | 531.47 | 1.299x | 14.03 | 3.66 |
| 12 | 416.15 | 524.17 | 1.260x | 14.40 | 3.64 |
| 13 | 472.43 | 593.05 | 1.255x | 14.85 | 3.68 |
| 14 | 431.25 | 617.36 | 1.432x | 14.98 | 3.72 |
| 15 | 473.71 | 587.14 | 1.239x | 15.68 | 3.59 |
| 16 | 554.15 | 717.98 | 1.296x | 15.34 | 3.73 |

All tested concurrency points exceed the 1.2x throughput requirement. The
minimum is 1.239x at C15; the maximum is 1.501x at C9.

## Controller behavior

The refill controller no longer waits for a fixed running-request threshold.
It preserves each active decode cohort and admits queued requests when that
cohort drains. This avoids mixing prefill work into a recurrent EAGLE3 decode
cohort and avoids repeated graph-width and GDN-state transitions. The initial
cohort is released by an arrival quiet-period/max-wait rule rather than a fixed
batch size.

Gamma remains independently adaptive over 1-6. Across this C16-to-C1 run, the
controller selected gamma 3/4/5/6 and performed 51 gamma switches. The final
batch-bucket choices were gamma 4 for B1/B2/B4, gamma 3 for B8, and gamma 5 for
B16. Candidate gamma 1-6 were all launched during online exploration.

The tradeoff is increased queueing/TTFT under burst load because a new request
does not enter a partially drained cohort. The acceptance criterion in this
test is output throughput relative to target-only, not TTFT or SLO goodput.
